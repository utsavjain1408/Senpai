# Senpai
Senpai is an online pedagogy networking service which gives sharing and collaborating in the
field of pedagogy a sound and efficient structure and will evolve with needs. Senpai aims to
enhance student­mentor interaction and make it more efficient and lively with the use of online
services and interactive user forums. Senpai consists of three different types of users with
different set of functionality, viz. “Student”, ”Teacher”, ”Organization”. Two of the most
significant functional components of senpai are “Classroom” and ”Staffroom”. ”Classroom”s
will be created by “Teacher”s and they will add “Student”s. “Staffroom”s will be created by
“Organization”s and they will add “Teacher”s .“Student”s can get access to all their study
content in one place. Senpai is a one stop solution for the communication barrier that exists
today. Senpai can also become a bridge which will support inter college collaborative events.
Senpai is a cloud based windows desktop application which employs Microsoft Azure Cloud
Services to fulfill its database need. This provides easy on the go scalability when the Senpai
gains momentum
